This project is my testing of creating an SPA using React, 
React Router, React Hooks and adding animations using the 
Framer Motion Library which was created for react.

This project is heavily inspired by Shaun Pelling (known
as TheNetNinja on youtube) and his tutorial series on 
Framer Motion.
